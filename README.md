feb 12th 2026 _just finished 2.2 examinations for my chemical engineering degree._

#Recarping for the past several days on majors and basics of code.#
basically i've been in a flow state.
Plan to start the projects once i move and settle in a new rental.
projects in mind::

big3
1.basic physics engine(simple laws... )==> target reddit for science and engineering. 🔥🔧⚓

2.basic chemistry engine (reactions and visualizations ...)=>target reddit for science and engineering. ⚙⚗🧪⚕

3.more advanced simulations(human simulation, truck simulations)=>[ assimp and animation loading]

...ALSO MORE COMPLEX IDEAS AFTER SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTING THESE
{
    A company for simulations, and ai environmental whatever 😂
}

currency for the big 3 ==> 4 months before academic pressure;

Anyway:::

feb 14th 2026///___just glfw and gl recarps.. called it the window recarp.__
feb 15th 2026///___recarping on major render pipeline , buffers and stuff__
feb 16th 2026///___added very tiny features to the recarp files:: reason... tiresome day househunting :) fuck the rich who always have eeverything the easy way ... bwahahahahaha.__

feb 22nd 2026///___An engineers odesy or whatever, successfully moved to a new location, cheap and affordable, far from uni but a road cross away from the air strip atleast. Already settled. Been doing ultra recarps for the pst several days, managed framebuffers and cube maps plus fixed the camera issues, what is left is some more advanced cconcepts, learn lighting and imgui which am lanning to do tonight. anway , the house wins bwahahaha. had a dream impregnating a lady, perhaps Rose, not sure, smt for sure though, she was damn beautiful.__
