feb 12th 2026 _just finished 2.2 examinations for my chemical engineering degree._

#Recarping for the past several days on majors and basics of code.#
basically i've been in a flow state.
Plan to start the projects once i move and settle in a new rental.
projects in mind::

big3
1.basic physics engine(simple laws... )==> target reddit for science and engineering. 🔥🔧⚓

2.basic chemistry engine (reactions and visualizations ...)=>target reddit for science and engineering. ⚙⚗🧪⚕

3.more advanced simulations(human simulation, truck simulations)=>[ assimp and animation loading]

...ALSO MORE COMPLEX IDEAS AFTER SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTING THESE
{
    A company for simulations, and ai environmental whatever 😂
}

currency for the big 3 ==> 4 months before academic pressure;
